README MicrosatFinder v 0.1b; Copyright 2005, Brant C. Faircloth

About the files in the archive
-------------
After unzipping the archive (see Installation), you should have a folder of 6 files:
      -gpl.txt (a copy of the GNU Public License)
      -MicrosatFinder (an application bundle for OS X that is the executable file - e.g. this is the drag-and-droppable part)
      -MicrosatFinder (the source of the application bundle)
      -msat_cl.py (a command line version of MicrosatFinder for use on other OSs)
      -README (this file)

About this program
-------------
MicrosatFinder depends on Python to run the program/script.  On OS X, python is installed by default.  On other operating systems, you may have to install python.
See python.org for instructions.  Additionally, the executable file (MicrosatFinder) will not work on other OSs, so you are stuck with the command-line version, for now.

True to the ancestor of this program, msat_finder will scan for the lowest alphabetical designation for all di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats.  The program (executable) is drag-and-drop compatible - meaning that you can drop a sequence file or a folder of sequence files on the program for scanning.  These files must be text files, and it helps (you) if they are consensus files, although that does not matter to the program.

Right now, this program should be treated as a 'beta' version (e.g. there are likely some bugs).  Use at your own risk.  Parts of the source are ugly.  They will be streamlined at some point.  Please email faircloth@gmail.com if you find a bug with its description and your OS and OS version-number.


Installation on OS X:
-------------
1)  Unzip and untar the downloaded folder if your browser does not do this automatically (you can use stuffit expander)
2)  Drag sequence files or folders of sequence files onto the MicrosatFinder icon.
3)  Output from the program will be written to the file 'output.txt' located within the directory of the sequences (or the directory of the sequence) you are scanning.

You can put the MicrosatFinder executable in the Dock on OS X for easy access.  

Installation of command-line version on other OSs:
-------------
1)  Leave the file (msat_cl.py) in the directory it created or move it wherever you like.

2)  Invoke the program by navigating to the folder in your command-line program of choice and run it with (at minimum):

      $python msat_cl.py -f /path/to/your/sequence_file_or_folder

Command-line options include:
      
      -f [file_of sequences]
      -o [output file location]
      -v [verbose output - e.g. writes to terminal and output folder.  No option to suppress file writing yet]
      -h [shows command-line options]

Additionally, you can start the program using:
      $python msat_cl.py
      
And you will be prompted for input.
      
Microsatellite Sequences
-------------
True to the ancestor of this program, msat_finder will scan for the lowest alphabetical designation for all di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats.  These lists include:
      mononuc=['(A)','(C)'] 
      dinuc=['(AC)','(AG)','(AT)','(CG)'] 
      trinuc=['(AAC)','(AAG)','(AAT)','(ACC)','(ACG)','(ACT)','(AGC)','(AGG)','(ATC)','(CCG)']
      tetranuc=['(AAAC)','(AAAG)','(AAAT)','(AACC)','(AACG)','(AACT)','(AAGC)','(AAGG)','(AAGT)','(ACAG)','(ACAT)','(ACCC)','(ACCG)','(ACCT)','(ACGC)','(ACGT)','(ACTC)','(ACTG)','(AGAT)','(AATC)','(AATG)','(AATT)','(ACGG)','(AGCC)','(AGCG)','(AGGC)','(AGGG)','(ATCC)','(ATCG)','(ATGC)','(CCCG)','(CCGG)']

The program also searches for the complement of these repeats.

Minimum number of repeats
-------------
This program will search for microsatellites with the following minimum number of repeats:
Mononucleotide: 10 repeat units
Dinucleotide: 7 repeat units
Trinucleotide:  5 repeat units
Tetranucleotide:  4 repeat units

These values may be edited in the command-line source should you like to try something different.  They are found on line 47 as such:

{"mono":'{10,}',"di":'{7,}',"tri":'{5,}',"tetra":'{4,}'

If you desire to search for a higher/lower number of repeats, simply change the integer values for the repeat(s) to an integer of your choice.  Save the file, and re-run the command-line application.  This option is not available for the executable version unless you want to rebuild the application bundle after editing the MicrosatFinder_source.py file. 

Other Repeats
-------------
If someone wants to come up with a list of possible pentanucleotide repeats, that's great.  If you send them to me, I will include the patters.

N Bases
-------------

This program has been set up to count N (unknown) bases as microsat repeats if they exist within a microsat repeat area and are followed by a true repeat (e.g. 'aaag' or 'ag').  They are not counted in other cases.

Performance
-------------
I have tested msat_finder on a folder of 280 consensus sequence files which took 6 seconds to scan.
